Animation Issue
If you encounter issues with AOS animation not working on the provided link, it may be due to a problem with importing AOS. 
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yugalj7/Japanese-Food-web.github.io.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Japanese-Food-web.github.io

Install the project dependencies:

npm install
Run the development server:

npm run dev
This will start a development server, and you can view the website with the correct AOS animation by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Please note that this issue might be related to the AOS import or initialization in the current deployed version. 
Running the project locally using the development server (npm run dev) should resolve the animation problem.
